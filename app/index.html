          <h5 class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase text-left">Quick Note:</h5>
          <p>Bozeman is located 4,800 ft above sea level. We're no medical experts but eating well, sleeping well and consuming lots of water should help you stay healthy throughout your stay in the mountains.</p>

          <h5 class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase text-left">Weather in Early September:</h5>
          <p class="text-left">September is typically a comfortable month in Bozeman with high's in the mid 70's and the lows in the mid 40's at night.  Rain isn't frequent but make sure to check the forecast in the weeks leading up to your travels.</p>

          <p>Last year around this time we had some pretty bad wildfires in the surrounding areas. We're hoping with the increase snowfall this winter that we won't have a repeat of last summer/fall BUT please watch the forecast and know that it could be smokey. Low visibility could dampen the fun of any hike your thinking about going on and activities of moderate to high level of exertion could be unsafe. If you're planning on making a trip to Yellowstone National Park or Glacier National Park be aware of possible closures due to inclement weather and or active wildfires.</p>
          <p>We haven't seen snow in the mountains in early September in the time that we've lived here but it's always possible. Just be watching the forecast (this would really only impact the long hike planned on Thursday).</p>

          <h5 class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase text-left">Your suitcase:</h5>
          <p><strong>Packing to dress in layers would be the wisest decision.</strong> Comfortable pants would be helpful if you plan on hiking. A sweathshirt or two to cover yourself at night should keep you warm enough (maybe even light fall jacket). Bring comfortable walking shoes whether you plan to sightsee in town or venture out on a hike!</p>
